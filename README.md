# Samsung-HealthSpace

## Synopsis
This project was designed and created in Android Studio during Samsung Note 8 Hackathon in Mountain View, CA.
I decided to create another version of the Mock-Ups in Xcode (using Swift) as well.

## What does the app do
The app is a B2B solution for corporate wellness. The app has three main features - a biometrics based task manager, 
medical leave system, and employee reward system. The task manager takes in biometrics through the health apps on either a
Android Phone or a Apple Device. Further, the app aims to use these biomentrics to match with suitable tasks that takes
employees health status into consideration through K-Means clustering. Further, the app solves the bottlenect that is a 
medical leave systems. In this app, employees can send full-status reports of their leaves, and have it signed by their
managers as fast as possible. Lastly, there is a employee reward system. Here, employers post health tasks' for employees to
conduct (example: "join this corporate yoga event"). When employees join events, they earn "polygons" which they can collect,
and use these to get amazing offers. Ex. Jared did this, gained 10 polygons, and was awarded a ticket to the Samsung S9 Launch 
event, and also felt much better at work.

(Most features is not in these files, because they have the sole purpose of being mock-ups.)

## Motivation
Today, 8 out of 10 people report feeling of fatigue at work. Workplace fatigue accounts for annual productivity losses of on
average about $2000 per person, a total of $136 billion each year. Hence, our team saw it fitting to address this problem, and
focused on finding a creative solution where we were able to integrate Samsung products.
